All notable changes to this project will be documented in this auto-generated
file. The format is based on [Conventional Commits][1];
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning][2].

## [12.0.0-canary.1][3] (2024-03-13)

### üí• Breaking Changes üí•

- Minimum supported Node.js version is now 18.19.0

- Default exports are no longer available. See usage instructions
  for details on proper import syntax.

- Due to prettier\@3 forcing downstream adoption of their
  asynchronous interface, `ResultFormatter` is no longer synchronous and can now
  return a `Promise`.

- Adoption of prettier\@3 requires some versions of Node to be
  executed with the `--experimental-vm-modules` option. E.g.
  `NODE_OPTIONS="--no-warnings --experimental-vm-modules" npx jest`.

- Attempting to install babel-plugin-tester alongside jest@<30
  will cause NPM to fail with `ERESOLVE`. This is because only jest@>=30
  (jest-snapshot) supports the prettier\@3 asynchronous interface.

#### ‚ú® Features

### [11.0.4][12] (2023-01-25)

#### ü™Ñ Fixes

### [11.0.3][14] (2023-01-24)

#### ü™Ñ Fixes

## [11.0.0][23] (2023-01-18)

### üí• Breaking Changes üí•

- **`error` no longer accepts arbitrary class constructors**

  `error` (aka `throws`) no longer accepts arbitrary class constructors. Any
  provided class constructor must extend `Error`, e.g. built-ins like
  `SyntaxError` or custom error classes like `class MyError extends Error`. Thanks
  to the nature of JavaScript, **providing a class constructor that does not
  extend `Error` will lead to undefined behavior**.

- **`error` only captures exceptions from Babel**

  `error` (aka `throws`) no longer potentially captures exceptions thrown by the
  `formatResult` function. If the `formatResult` function throws, the entire test
  will fail immediately.

- **`TypeError` for config error; `AssertionError` for test error**

  All configuration-related issues now throw `TypeError` instead of
  `AssertionError`. `AssertionError` is now exclusively used for failing tests.
  Additionally, the text of some error messages has been updated.

- **All test titles are now numbered**

  All test titles are now numbered (e.g. `"1. ..."`, `"2. ..."`, etc), including
  fixtures tests and tests with custom titles.

- **Built-in TypeScript support**

  TypeScript types are now included within the package itself, obviating the need
  to install a separate types package. Installing the old types package alongside
  this version of babel-plugin-tester will cause conflicts.

- **Fixture configuration schema is standardized**

  In previous versions of babel-plugin-tester, you could provide any key to
  `options.json` and it would be passed as-is to the plugin under test. This made
  it impossible to allow fixtures to be configured with the same flexibility as
  test objects. In this version of babel-plugin-tester, fixture `options.json`
  (and `options.js`) files must return a standard set of options. Non-standard
  properties are silently ignored. For instance: to pass options to the plugin
  under test, they must be provided via `pluginOptions`.

- **Global `describe` and `it` functions must be defined**

  babel-plugin-tester will refuse to run if `describe`, `it`, `it.only`, or
  `it.skip` are not globally available.

- **Global `setup`/`teardown` no longer overwrites local versions**

  In previous versions of babel-plugin-tester, test-level `setup` and `teardown`
  functions overrode global `setup` and `teardown` functions. In this version of
  babel-plugin-tester, the global `setup` and `teardown` functions will be called
  alongside their test-level counterparts for each test and in a well-defined
  order (see documentation).

- **Implicit "global" options merging is no longer supported**

  In previous versions of babel-plugin-tester, any test object and fixture
  configuration option could be passed directly to babel-plugin-tester and apply
  "globally" across all test objects and fixtures. This was even the case for
  options that made no sense in a "global" context, such as `only`, `skip`, and
  `code`. In this version of babel-plugin-tester, only options explicitly listed
  in the documentation can be passed directly and applied globally. Unrecognized
  "rest" options are silently ignored.

- **Test/fixture configuration is resolved early and consistently**

  In previous versions of babel-plugin-tester, test object and fixture
  configuration options were resolved in various places, with some options getting
  finalized before `it(...)` and `describe(...)` were called and others being
  determined as Jest was executing the test. In this version, all configuration
  options are resolved and finalized before `it(...)` and `describe(...)` are
  called. This also means configurations are finalized _before_ hooks like
  `beforeAll` get called by the testing framework.

- `babelOptions.filename` is now set to `filepath`
  by default rather than `undefined`.

- In previous versions, the lodash.mergeWith customizer skipped source properties
  that resolved to `undefined`. With this version, the customizer now unsets these properties
  (sets them to `undefined`), allowing the end user to easily unset defaults (e.g. `filename`).

- Minimum recommended node version bumped from
  10.13.0 to 14.20.0

- Plugin names are once again automatically determined
  by analyzing the return value of the plugin function. Though this is
  implemented in a backwards-compatible way, there is a
  [small caveat][24].
